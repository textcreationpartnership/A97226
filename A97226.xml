            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>GOod People, I am by the juſt Judgment of God brought hither to Suffer, and fearing I may not be heard by many, for the ſake of thoſe that Survive me, I leave this Paper with the <hi>S—ffs,</hi> to be diſpoſed off according to their Diſcretion for the Publick Good, with this</hi> Declaration, <hi>that what is contained therein, is really true, as the Great God is my Witneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. I do freely forrgive all the World, and particularly thoſe that have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Malicious Scandals and falſe Aſperſions upon me; and among thoſe, Mr. <hi>B— A—</hi> the Maſter of the Ship, who has, as I have been In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, reported many Notorious Falſities of me, to the hindering (as I have reaſon to think) ſome farther intended Mercy to me from Man, but as I hope, my Good and Gracious God has forgiven me, a poor Sinful Creature, much greater Sins then Man can have Committed againſt me; ſo I heartily forgive all my Enemies, Perſecuters and Slanderers, all that have done me any Wrong, and as I heartily ask Forgiveneſs of all I have Injur'd, and I beſeech God to forgive all as I do, with Horror and Deteſtation, and great Sorrow of Heart, I Confeſs that I did ſhed the Blood of the Man, for which great Sin I juſtly ſuffer for, but yet I muſt ſay, I had no Premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Malice againſt him; but on the contrary, a kindneſs for him, but having Drank hard, and then Quarelling, I raſhly brought my Self to this End, for which I pray God forgive me.</p>
            <p>But what has been Reported, of being a <hi>Buckenere,</hi> having treated Men Barbarouſly, and having kill'd other Men beſides this, which is utterly falſe, for which I Praiſe and Glorifie my God. But yet I muſt Confeſs, that I have been a very grievous Sinner, and ſhould God deal with me accordingly, I muſt Periſh Everlaſtingly. But all Glory be to him for his Merciful Aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I am ſincerely Sorrowful, and I am truly Penitent for all and every Sin that ever I have Committed, againſt God or Man, and am thereupon full of Hopes, that my long Suffering and moſt Compaſſionate (though much offended) God, has for the ſake of my Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, pardoned all my Sins, for I believe there is Virtue enough in the Blood of my Crucifyed Redeemer, to waſh away the fouleſt ſtains off of my Soul, and that he that has made me Penitent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will ſave me for His Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

And that I may do all the good I can to thoſe that Survive me I earneſtly beg and intreat you all, both Young and Old, to beware of all and every Sin, and moſt eſpecially of Idleneſs, for the Devil then is moſt Buſie, and generally moſt ſucceſsful in his Temptations, for want of impro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving your precious time.

Pray for God's Grace and Mercy, at leaſt Morning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, give God the Glory of his Mercy, and do your utmoſt endeavours to walk before the Lord in Holineſs of Life, learn from the Temporal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon me, to beware of Sin, and learn from the Comforta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble Experience I have of God's Mercy, not to diſpare if you run on in Sin, you may not repent, but if you repent now, you will eſcape Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as I ſtedfaſtly believe through Jeſus Chriſt. I do freely forgive all the World, and all thoſe that I have wronged or abuſed, if I did know, I would make Reſtitution if I could, but ſince I cannot, I hope they all will forgive me, as I hope the Lord will forgive us all; therefore I bid this Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful World Adieu, wiſhing that all People would mend their Lives, and turn to the Lord, for fear his Anger ſhould ariſe. Into the Hands of the Lord I commit my Spirit, beſeeching thee O Lord to ſpeak Peace to my Soul, and ſay, Soul be of good Comfort, thy Sins be forgiven, that likewiſe O Lord in the Moment of time, ſay O Lord, come this Day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe, and ſo farewell this Wicked World.</p>
